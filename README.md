# Command line and git

## Talking points
- Command line
	- What is it?
	- How do we go about using it?

- Command line commands to memorize:
    - `ls` lists files and directories within current directory
    - `pwd` print working directory
    - `cd` change directory
    - `..` move up one directory
    - `/` strings together directories/file names in a path to traverse
    - `~` root directory of the computer and a shortcut to get there as well
    - `mkdir` make directory, followed by the name of the directory you want to make, will be put in the current location
    - `touch`make a file, followed by the name of the file you want to make, will be put in the current directory
    - `rm` remove file followed by the name of the file you want to move
    - `rmdir` remove directory (empty only)
    - `cp` copies a file or folder, takes the name of the file or folder to copy and the name of the new file or folder to create
    - tab completion - is your best friend, use it to avoid typos
    - up and down arrow keys to repeat previous commands without re-typing them
